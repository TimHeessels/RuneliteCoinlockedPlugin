# Coinlocked game mode
Everything is locked, gather coins to choose what to unlock next!

## Gameplay
You start off with next to nothing unlocked (Full list at the bottom of the page). With every new peak wealth reached, you may open a new booster pack of unlock cards and choose one, slowly unlocking the game one card at a time.

The side panel shows a list of all the things you can unlock and have unlocked so far.

Some cards can only appear in packs when you reach their requirements.

### Rules

## Important note
The plugin uses al-kharid flyers to block inventory spaces. At the start of the game mode (and whenever you carry too little of them) it will ask you to gather a certain amount.
Once you've collected enough they will turn into locked icons. They cannot be interacted with or dragged, so if you want a different inventory layout, disable the plugin and drag the flyers to the spaces you want.

Use the drop-trick to get 27 flyers from [Ali the Leaflet Dropper](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ali_the_Leaflet_Dropper).
